# HAL: Real-time clock basics

This example demonstrates the usage of the real-time clock (RTC) in Infineon MCU. It shows how to get and set the time in the RTC using the RTC HAL API. The example also supports the daylight saving time (DST) feature. A UART interface is used to input the time and configure the RTC.

## Operation

If using a PSoC&trade; 64 "Secure" MCU kit (like CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W), the PSoC&trade; 64 device must be provisioned with keys and policies before being programmed. Follow the instructions in the ["Secure Boot" SDK user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdlac/Infineon-PSoC_64_Secure_MCU_Secure_Boot_SDK_User_Guide-Software-v07_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0f8c361a7666) to provision the device. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "HAL: RTC Basics" is displayed on the UART terminal.

    **Figure 1. Terminal window on startup**

    ![](images/terminal_output_1.png)

5. Type `1` in the main menu. You will be prompted for new date and time. Enter the new date and time, and press **Enter**.

   If an incorrect date or time is entered, a warning message is printed.

    **Figure 2. Set time command**

    ![](images/terminal_output_2.png)


6. Type `2` in the main menu. You will be prompted to configure the DST feature in the sub menu.

   The current DST status will be displayed along with the available DST commands.

    **Figure 3. Configure DST feature command**

    ![](images/terminal_output_3.png)


7. Type `1` in the sub-menu. When prompted, enter the DST format (*Fixed DST format* or *Relative DST format*), followed by the new DST start and end time.

    If an incorrect date or time is entered, a warning message is printed.

    **Figure 4. Enable DST feature command**

    ![](images/terminal_output_4.png)

    **Note:** While using DST, it can either be in fixed DST format or in a relative DST format.

      An example of fixed DST format: begins on 21st March and ends on 21st September.

      An example of relative DST format: begins on the last Sunday of March and ends on the last Sunday of October.

8. Type `2` in the sub-menu to disable the DST feature:

    **Figure 5. 'Disable DST feature' command**

    ![](images/terminal_output_5.png)

9. Type `3` in the sub-menu to quit DST configuration:

    **Figure 6. 'Quit DST configuration' command**

    ![](images/terminal_output_6.png)



## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code.


<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

> **Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

</details>


<details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.

## Design and implementation

This code example features the RTC resource and one UART resource. The RTC resource provides time and date information – second, minute, hour, day of the week, date, month, and year. The time and date information are updated every second with automatic leap-year compensation performed by the RTC hardware block.

The CPU waits for the line feed (LF) or the carriage return (CR) character from the serial terminal. When it is received, the code parses the commands that have been sent:

- If the input command is ‘1’, updates the RTC with the new date and time

- If the input command is ‘2’, enters the sub-menu where you can configure the DST feature using the following inputs:

    - If the input command is ‘1’ in the sub-menu, updates the RTC, when DST should start and end

    - If the input command is ‘2’ in the sub menu, disables the DST feature

    - If the input command is ‘3’ in the sub menu, quits the DST configuration

The application uses the RTC resource from the [Hardware abstraction layer](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-hal-cat1) (HAL) to read or update the RTC peripheral.

An RTC HAL resource is configured as a pointer to an RTC object whose contents are initialized by the `cyhal_rtc_init` function. This function also powers up the RTC in preparation for access.

The current time and date can be read from the RTC peripheral using the `cyhal_rtc_read`  function. Similarly, the `cyhal_rtc_write` function is used to write the specified time and date to the RTC peripheral.

In addition to these methods, the DST feature can be configured using the following functions:

- `set_dst_feature`: To enable the DST feature. Internally uses RTC HAL functions.

- `cyhal_rtc_set_dst`: To set DST start and end time

- `cyhal_rtc_is_dst `: To check if DST is currently active

# HAL: Watchdog Timer


This example explains how to set up a Watchdog Timer (WDT) using the [WDT](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-hal-cat1/html/group__group__hal__wdt.html) HAL resource. The WDT resets the device if it is not serviced or "kicked" within the configured timeout interval. This helps in recovering the program from an unintended lock up.

By default, the WDT is reset at least once within each timeout interval to avoid a device reset. The user LED toggles every 1 s in the main loop to indicate that the CPU is in action. In addition, the user LED blinks once for power cycling or an external reset event.

Enable an infinite loop in the `main()` function to block the execution. The device resets in ~4 s. The user LED blinks twice after the device comes out of reset.

</details>

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[mtb-example-hal-wdt](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-hal-wdt)" application with the desired name "Watchdog_Timer" configured for the *CY8CPROTO-062S2-43439* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CPROTO-062S2-43439 --app-id mtb-example-hal-wdt --user-app-name Watchdog_Timer --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

 Argument | Description | Required/optional
 ---------|-------------|-----------
 `--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
 `--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
 `--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
 `--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

</details>




## Operation

If using a PSoC&trade; 64 "Secure" MCU kit (like CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W), the PSoC&trade; 64 device must be provisioned with keys and policies before being programmed. Follow the instructions in the ["Secure Boot" SDK user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdlac/Infineon-PSoC_64_Secure_MCU_Secure_Boot_SDK_User_Guide-Software-v07_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0f8c361a7666) to provision the device. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Enable the blocking function ( to demonstrate WDT reset ) by updating the macro `ENABLE_BLOCKING_FUNCTION` in the main.c as shown below:
    ```
        #define ENABLE_BLOCKING_FUNCTION             1      
    ```

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. Observe the status of the LEDs based on different events summarized as follows:

 Project Setting | LED Status 
 :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- 
 With the blocking function | After approximately 4 s, the device resets and the user LED blinks twice within a second to indicate a WDT reset. 
 Without the blocking function| User LED toggles every 1 s to indicate that the CPU is in action. 

Note that the user LED blinks once on a power cycle or an external reset event.



## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code.


<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

> **Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

</details>


<details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.

## Design and implementation


### Resources and settings

**Table 1. Application Resources**

 Resource  |  Alias/Object     |    Purpose     
 :------- | :------------    | :------------ 
 WDT (HAL) | wdt_obj          | WDT driver to configure the hardware resource 
 GPIO (HAL)    | CYBSP_USER_LED         | User LED                  

The WDT in PSoC 6 MCU is a 16-bit timer and uses the Internal Low-Speed Oscillator (ILO) clock of 32 kHz. The WDT is configured using HAL APIs. These APIs configure the ignore bits and the match count for the desired period. The total timeout period of the WDT consists of three match events. To avoid a WDT reset, firmware must clear the WDT before the third match event.

**Notes:**

The interrupt should never be enabled and the WDT match event should always be cleared in the main loop. If interrupt is enabled, upon an interrupt, it needs to be cleared to avoid repeated execution of the WDT interrupt handler. This removes the actual purpose of the WDT.

The `WDT_TIME_OUT_MS` macro specifies the timeout for the reset event in milliseconds. The default value is `4000`. Change this value to get a different time out. The maximum timeout that can be set is given by `CYHAL_WDT_MAX_TIMEOUT_MS`.

To simulate a malfunction, the main loop contains a blocking function (infinite `while` loop). Enabling this blocking function causes WDT match events not to be cleared. After three match events, the device resets. The firmware blinks the user LED twice when the device comes out of reset.

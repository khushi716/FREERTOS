## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

Two devices are required to verify the output: one for the master and one for the slave.

1. Use the [mtb-example-hal-spi-slave](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-hal-spi-slave) example to run as SPI slave on the second kit.

2. Connect CYBSP_SPI_SCLK, CYBSP_SPI_MOSI, CYBSP_SPI_MISO and CYBSP_SPI_CS pins of the master to CYBSP_SPI_SCLK, CYBSP_SPI_MOSI, CYBSP_SPI_MISO and CYBSP_SPI_CS pins of slave using jumper wires.

> **Note:** The PSoC&trade; 6 Bluetooth&reg; LE Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. ModusToolbox&trade; requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

The AIROC&trade; CYW20829 Bluetooth&reg; ships with KitProg3 version 2.21 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; requires KitProg3 with the latest version (2.40). Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/Infineon/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error such as "Unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

In AIROC&trade; CYW20829 Bluetooth&reg; kit (CYW920829M2EVK-02,CYW989829M2EVB-03) the SPI (CS, CLK) and User Button2, USER LED1 share the same GPIOs, while you need SPI USER LED1 will be glowing based on SPI CLK activity. The SWD and SPI (MOSI, MISO) interfaces share the same GPIOs and must use one interface at a time. See the table below to make SPI connections:

 SPI signal       | SCB pin    | Header pin
 :--------------- | :--------- | :---------------
 SCLK             | P1[1]      |   J18.1
 MOSI             | P1[2]      |   J4.6
 MISO             | P1[3]      |   J4.5
 CS               | P1[0]      |   J4.4

In AIROC&trade; CYW89829 Bluetooth&reg; kit (CYW989829M2EVB-01) Bluetooth&reg;.See the table below to make SPI connections:
 SPI signal       | SCB pin    | Header pin
 :--------------- | :--------- | :---------------
 SCLK             | P0[4]      |   J7.3
 MOSI             | P0[2]      |   J9.3
 MISO             | P0[3]      |   J9.4
 CS               | P0[0]      |   J6.5

**Note:** This code examples provides the custom design.modus files under template directory for few BSPs, because these BSPs do not have aliases for the SPI pins by default (e.g. CYBSP_SPI_MOSI, CYBSP_SPI_MISO, CYBSP_SPI_SCLK, CYBSP_SPI_CS). The other BSPs already have those aliases defined in the default design.modus file, thus do not need any customization.

## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).


## Using the code example

The ModusToolbox&trade; tools package provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool.

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator GUI</b></summary>

1. Open the Project Creator GUI tool.

   There are several ways to do this, including launching it from the dashboard or from inside the Eclipse IDE. For more details, see the [Project Creator user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/docs/project-creator.pdf*).

2. On the **Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** page, select a kit supported by this code example. See [Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target).

   > **Note:** To use this code example for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. On the **Select Application** page:

   a. Select the **Applications(s) Root Path** and the **Target IDE**.

   > **Note:** Depending on how you open the Project Creator tool, these fields may be pre-selected for you.

   b.	Select this code example from the list by enabling its check box.

   > **Note:** You can narrow the list of displayed examples by typing in the filter box.

   c. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name** and **New BSP Name**.

   d. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

</details>

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[SPI master](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-hal-spi-master)" application with the desired name "MySpiMaster" configured for the *CY8CPROTO-062S2-43439* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CPROTO-062S2-43439 --app-id mtb-example--hal-spi-master --user-app-name MySpiMaster --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```


The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

## Operation

If using a PSoC&trade; 64 "Secure" MCU kit (like CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W), the PSoC&trade; 64 device must be provisioned with keys and policies before being programmed. Follow the instructions in the ["Secure Boot" SDK user guide](https://www.infineon.com/dgdlac/Infineon-PSoC_64_Secure_MCU_Secure_Boot_SDK_User_Guide-Software-v07_00-EN.pdf?fileId=8ac78c8c7d0d8da4017d0f8c361a7666) to provision the device. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that the UART terminal displays as shown in **Figure 1**.

   **Figure 1. Terminal output on program startup**

## Debugging


You can debug the example to step through the code.


<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

> **Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

</details>


<details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
</details>



## Design and implementation

The Arm&reg; Cortex&reg; CPU controls the master SPI resource. The master sends packets to the slave with the command to turn ON or OFF the user LED. The packets are sent at an interval of one second. The slave receives the packets and controls the LED according to the command.

**Note:** For CYW989829M2EVB-03 board, use Blue LED to blink.
